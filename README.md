## Latar Belakang

Hi there! I am Eli :)
I have graduated form Institut Teknologi Bandung for around 3 years ago majoring Agricultural Engineering.
Guess what?
College has done me nothing. Well, I know it's rough to say.
I have to gone trhough a series of heartbreaks after the graduation besides of the truth that my daddy passed away right before the TA defense.
My first job was a research assistant to my professor for almost a year.
Right after I finished my working contract there, I dediced to dive in the agribusiness world along with my 4 friends.
We were aiming to trade coffee beans abroad for we have the channel and resources but things went not as planned.
Then I was experiencing some self discoveries with the help of Capacitar International for the first stepping stone.
Fast forward, I have moved on from that breaking moment. Then I have landed myself to my first job as a teacher in Engineering and Robotic class for kids.
Wasn't happy with that, I throw myself to Hacktiv. Thank God I've taste the feel of coding back then when I was in Highschool and in my first year of College. I've been taught with Pascal and C++ and got a good score from it!
Here again I'm aiming to thrive on that "side of my potential"
Plis wish me a good luck :)
